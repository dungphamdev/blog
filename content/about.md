Hi, I'm Tommy. This blog is where I review my knowledge and experiences, and share with the community what I know. The posts will focus on backend (.NET because that's how I make a living), databases, system design, etc., and Iâ€™ll try to dive as deep as possible with the knowledge I have, not just stopping at quick tutorials - because those are the things I really want to write about. Enjoy reading :)
